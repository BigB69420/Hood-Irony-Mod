1.4.4 Port of this garbage

This mod is the psychotic work of a sadistic man, this mod implements multiple dead memes and inside jokes that i am sure will make even the strongest cringe. Included in the long line of hot garbage is Blud, the amalgamation of 21st century humour made into one astoundingly useless town npc.

Aside from Blud being the remnants of a dead meme, he sells boss bags that might make your hellish experience easier

For this irrelevant monstrosity to infest your tenants home, you only need a copper shortsword after that Blud will find you

Any hate is openly accepted and i still regret making this mod to this day

Don't have fun, or do, I don't really care
